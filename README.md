## Who Am I?

I'm a full stack developer who genuinely enjoys building things for the web. There's something satisfying about taking an idea and turning it into something people can actually use — that's what keeps me going.

Most of my time goes into building web applications from the ground up. I handle everything from designing clean interfaces to setting up databases and APIs. I'm not the kind of developer who just throws code together and hopes it works. I care about the details — how the app feels, how fast it loads, whether the code will still make sense six months from now.

I started out focusing on frontend work, but over time I found myself wanting to understand the whole picture. Now I'm equally comfortable working on React components as I am writing database queries or setting up authentication flows. That said, I still have a soft spot for crafting really polished user interfaces.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually learning something new or experimenting with tools I haven't tried before. The web keeps evolving, and honestly, that's part of what makes it fun.

## What I'm Up To These Days

Right now, I'm diving deeper into a few things:

- **System design patterns** — figuring out how to build apps that scale without falling apart
- **Performance optimization** — making things fast isn't just nice, it actually matters for users
- **Better testing practices** — because I've been burned enough times by bugs in production

I'm also exploring serverless architectures and edge computing. The idea of running code closer to users is pretty compelling.

<br/>

## Let's Build Something

I'm always interested in working on projects that matter. Whether it's:

- An open source tool that solves a real problem
- A startup idea that needs a technical co-builder
- Anything involving complex frontend challenges

If you've got something interesting, I'd love to hear about it.

<br/>

## Things I Can Help With

If you're stuck on something, feel free to reach out. I've spent a lot of time with:

- Building full stack apps with Next.js
- Database design and optimization
- Making UIs actually feel good to use
- Authentication and security patterns
- Getting React apps to perform well

I don't claim to know everything, but I'm happy to share what I've learned.

<br/>

## Get In Touch

The best way to reach me is probably [Twitter/X](https://x.com/imsethidev) — my DMs are open. For anything more detailed, shoot me an [email](mailto:work.devsethi@gmail.com).

I try to respond to everyone, though it might take me a day or two if things are busy.
